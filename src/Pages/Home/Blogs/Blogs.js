            <h2>1 Difference between authorization and authentication</h2>
            <p>Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can come on board.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>2 Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h2> 
            <br/>
            <p>Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more</p>
            <h2>3 What other services does firebase provide other than authentication</h2>
